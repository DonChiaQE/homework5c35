	"body": "Some big changes have arrived in the app so if you haven't already, navigate to your email or the TestFlight app to grab the latest update. \n\nHere's what we've added in:\n\n– A completely refreshed design. The navigation of the app hasn't changed, just the way it looks. We wanted to try and capture the 'notebook' feeling, which was our original direction. We have also included some simple new animations around the app of various patents related to the photography industry, so let us know what you think of the new look!\n\n– When you add a shot there are some new things to view:\n    • The labelling now accurately shows which shot you are up to (huzzah!)\n    • When you select to over/under expose a shot (the 'EX' value), metering will now over/under expose depending which priority mode you're in. You'll need to click 'meter' for it to take effect.\n    • You can now also hide the light meter if you already have a handheld one or your camera has an in-built one. This should clean up the screen a bit!\n    • The 'custom' SS and A values now have new pop ups so you can input a value that we don't already provide. This will be mostly useful for exposures longer than 10 seconds or apertures like f/45 which you may find on some large format lenses. \n\n– Some of you experienced the app crashing when you tried to delete a shot from your roll, this should now be fixed. Let us know if it continues to persist. \n\nAnd that's it, we're still working hard on including some more features in the app which you'll see as 'coming soon' placeholders throughout. You can now directly email or join the discord server from our updates tab too. \n\nHappy shooting!"
