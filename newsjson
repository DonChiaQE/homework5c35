	"body": "The time has come! Version 1.0 is now alive on the App Store. \n\nWe’ve worked really hard to get what we consider the essentials into an app that’s available to as many analog photographers as possible. There will be updates in the future adding sounds, lens libraries and more - but for now, we have a perfectly working app that should get you by until those features make it in. \n\nA NOTE FOR BETA TESTERS: \n - If you have any photo references currently in the app and wish to save these please do this before you download 1.0 from the App Store. The system that we use to store and retrieve this data has changed and all photo references you have taken so far will not be carried across. \n - Metering and adding a shot with an old roll may cause the app to crash. We will work on a fix for this, but new rolls should not have any issues. \n\nThanks for the love this past year, we hope you’re all staying safe and ready to get into shooting some film! \n\nMuch love, \n\nJosh"

	"body": "Hey everyone!\n\nIt's been quite a while but we are here to push a small update through. There was an issue with adding shot descriptions that's not fixed.\n\nWe are working away in the background on a revamped experience of our app, and getting it ready to bring to Android as well. We've had a busy year so we all haven't spent as much time as we would have liked pushing through updates.\n\nHopefully next year sees much more from us! Until next time, keep shooting and logging.\n\nJosh"
