We didn't have enough time to implement a tutorial into this release, but I have made a video going through the app and how it's used: shorturl.at/aFHQ0 – sorry we can't hyperlink, we're working on it!

A couple of things to mention:
- If you decide to push/pull your film, our light meter does not detect it at the moment so you'll need to account for it yourself. This is also something we are working on.
- You will notice that there are 'custom' settings for SS and A when you go to add a shot. These are also not connected up properly yet but will be in the next update.

Other than that, our app should give you a solid start to logging your data – if you want to chat with us about anything we have instagram, email or discord. Happy shooting!",
