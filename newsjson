	"body": "Hello to all of our lovely beta testers, thanks so much for using our app – we're so excited to have people from all around the globe jumping onboard. \n\nThis will be our final beta release before we launch into the app store, so if there's absolutely ANYTHING you see, please send us a note. \n\n We also wish you all a happy holiday and new year, nossaflex is going to have a big 2021! \n\nThe new features in this update are: \n\n– There are some new sounds across the app, turn up the volume and have a click around. \n– When you now click the meter button with the lightmeter it also saves a reference image for you to compare later on. This reference image feature can be turned off in the setting page. \n– When you log a shot, you can now automatically log the location too. You'll need to give the app access to location services to do this. If you wish to turn it off you will need to do that via the iPhone Settings. You can also quick access this through the settings page in our app. \n– We have some new animations that will remind you how the current page works. If you see a question mark at the top of a page, click it to read about how it works. \n– There is now an edit button at the top of the shot detail page for easy access. \n\nAlong with that there have been some crashes happening with the lightmeter, we've fixed those but it seems to be a persistent issue. Please keep reporting the crashes if they happen! \n\nThanks again for using the nossaflex app this year – there's much more to come!"

	"body": "Some big changes have arrived in the app so if you haven't already, navigate to your email or the TestFlight app to grab the latest update. \n\nHere's what we've added in:\n\n– A completely refreshed design. The navigation of the app hasn't changed, just the way it looks. We wanted to try and capture the 'notebook' feeling, which was our original direction. We have also included some simple new animations around the app of various patents related to the photography industry, so let us know what you think of the new look!\n\n– When you add a shot there are some new things to view:\n    • The labelling now accurately shows which shot you are up to (huzzah!)\n    • When you select to over/under expose a shot (the 'EX' value), metering will now over/under expose depending which priority mode you're in. You'll need to click 'meter' for it to take effect.\n    • You can now also hide the light meter if you already have a handheld one or your camera has an in-built one. This should clean up the screen a bit!\n    • The 'custom' SS and A values now have new pop ups so you can input a value that we don't already provide. This will be mostly useful for exposures longer than 10 seconds or apertures like f/45 which you may find on some large format lenses. \n\n– Some of you experienced the app crashing when you tried to delete a shot from your roll, this should now be fixed. Let us know if it continues to persist. \n\nAnd that's it, we're still working hard on including some more features in the app which you'll see as 'coming soon' placeholders throughout. You can now directly email or join the discord server from our updates tab too. \n\nHappy shooting!"

	"body": "Welcome beta testers! Thanks so much for taking the time to help us with our app – we appreciate it! Hopefully the nossaflex app will help you log your data more efficiently and help you refer back to the data you've input.\n\nWe didn't have enough time to implement a tutorial into this release, but I have made a video going through the app and how it's used: shorturl.at/aFHQ0 – sorry we can't hyperlink, we're working on it!\n\nA couple of things to mention:\n- If you decide to push/pull your film, our light meter does not detect it at the moment so you'll need to account for it yourself. This is also something we are working on.\n- You will notice that there are 'custom' settings for SS and A when you go to add a shot. These are also not connected up properly yet but will be in the next update.\n\nOther than that, our app should give you a solid start to logging your data – if you want to chat with us about anything we have instagram, email or discord. Happy shooting!"
